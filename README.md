## üìù Notes & Tips

- **Only edit the `quiz`, `quiz1`, etc. sheets.** Avoid modifying `quiz_template`, `empty`, or helper sheets unless you're customizing.
- Use drop-downs for fields like **Scoring** and **Difficulty** to ensure valid entries.
- Always **Save your work** before exporting to prevent macro-related data loss.
- Leave a blank row between questions for readability (the template questions already contain a blank row).
- If a sheet breaks, copy a fresh one from `quiz_template`.
